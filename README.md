# MarkdownDeep, Act 2.

## It's alive!

It seems this project has stalled at its origin and a couple minor forks have been made. I am going to maintain this project on my repo for any future changes and pull requests that come through. 

This fork will retain the VS2010 origins, but will likely be refactored heavily. I am maintaining the upstream link as long as possible, but it is likely the changes will become too large for anyone to pull changes from my fork if they originally forked the root. At some point, I may drop the support for the js implementation as there are a handful of other libraries that handle this better.

[wwwlicious](https://github.com/wwwlicious/markdowndeep) has a fork for anyone who wants VS2012 support.

## Why?

I have been switching markdown engines back and forth on a few projects recently, and there seem to be no up to date implementations of c# markdown processors. I intend to follow the markdown specifications laid down by John Gruber, and support as much extensions as possible by enabling options.
