Markdowndeep, Act 2.

It seems this project has stalled at its origin and a couple minor forks have been made. I am going to maintain this project on my repo for any future changes and pull requests that come through. [https://github.com/wwwlicious/markdowndeep](wwwlicious) has a current fork as well for anyone who wants Visual Studio 2012 support, as this fork will retain the VS2010 origins until Visual Studio 2012 is finally released.
